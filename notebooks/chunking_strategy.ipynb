If ESIAs were to be carried out for each of the 41 \\nprojects, this would lead to duplication of effort, unnecessary cost, and loss of time. It would \\nalso be confusing to local communities and other stakeholders because of the large number \\nof public meetings required as part of the ESIA process.  \\n \\nIt is customary for the EEAA to require a Strategic/Regional Environmental and Social \\nAssessment (SESA) in the case of large projects with a cluster of similar/adjacent sub-\\nprojects, as is the case with the Benban Solar Park. NREA, supported by EBRD, initiated a \\nStrategic Environmental and Social Assessment (SESA) for the entire Benban site. The \\nobjective is to provide a high-level assessment, covering all key environmental and social \\nissues relating to the site. Developers of Benban Projects would then be expected to \\ncomplete a form B (scoped ESIA without Public Consultation) which addresses plot-specific \\nissues and contains commitment to addressing the SESA requirements. EBRD is funding \\nthis SESA and has commissioned EcoConServ and its partners to carry out this assignment, \\nin close cooperation with NREA, EEAA, and other authorities.  \\n \\n1.2 SESA Objectives \\n \\nThe overall objective of this SESA is to provide support for the assessment and subsequent \\nmanagement of the aggregate and cumulative environmental, health and safety, and social \\nimpacts of the proposed developments at the Benban PV site. More specifically, the SESA is \\nintended to do the following:   \\n• To assess the rationale and justification of the Benban Project as a whole.   \\n• To provide a high level summary of the baseline environmental and social situation \\nof the Benban Site and the surrounding area (including fauna and flora; land use and \\nacquisition; security issues; and presence of any cultural heritage sites), with a \\nparticular focus on the socioeconomic conditions. \\n• To provide a high level assessment of the EHSS impacts of a representative single 50 \\nMW Project.  \\n',\n",

Risks and impacts associated with all Benban projects in aggregate have been \\nconsidered where they are likely to have an effect on the local population and on human \\nhealth; on land, soil, water, air and climate; on landscape; on biodiversity; and on cultural \\nheritage. The SESA assesses these impacts separately and identify how they interact. \\nFurthermore, it identifies risks and suggests mitigation measures where appropriate.  \\n \\nThis Strategic Environmental and Social Impact Assessment broadly follows the steps of a \\nproject ESIA although it should not be taken as an ESIA for any one Benban project to be \\ndeveloped by any one project sponsor. The ESIA process consists of a defined set of steps \\nwith clear activities and outputs. This is in detail prescribed in national legislation as well as \\nEU Directives and IFI guidelines which have been broadly adopted for this SESA. The two \\nprimary phases followed for this process are as follows: \\n• The Scoping Phase: Scoping is a critical, early step in the preparation of an ESIA. \\nThe scoping process identifies the issues that are likely to be of most importance \\nduring the ESIA and eliminates what is of little concern. A key objective of this \\nphase is to identify available information, to establish gaps that have to be addressed, \\nand to discuss and decide what additional studies or investigation will have to be \\ndone to fill these gaps.

      "Section 2: 1 \tINTRODUCTION  This Outline Environmental & Social Management and Monitoring Plan (ESMMP) has been prepared as part of the Updated ESIA for the 485MW ACWA Power Zarqa CCGT Project being developed by ACWA Power Zarqa (the Project Company). This document is Volume 3 of the Updated ESIA and provides detailed environmental and social actions and initiatives that will be developed within the EPC contractors CESMP and the Operational & Maintenance Company’s OESMP, and will therefore be implemented during the construction and operational phases of the project.  This plan is a requirement of the  Jordanian Ministry of Environment and the projects lending institutions (notably EBRD and IFC).  As the information included to this Outline ESSMP is for use by the EPC Contractor (i.e. SEPCO III Electric Power Construction Corporation (SEPCO III)) and the O&M Company (i.e. Central Electrical Generating Company (CEGCO)) to develop their project specific CESMP and OESMP, the mention of any further management plans is intended as a guide for such documents to be prepared by the EPC or O&M respectively. Such documents must be prepared on a site-specific basis and must be relevant to the SEPCO III, any subcontractors  and CEGCO personnel, any specific external agencies and other stakeholders.  The action items proposed in the ESMMP are the minimum requirements that the contractors and operators must follow during construction and operation and are consistent with the mitigation and monitoring activities outlined in the Updated ESIA Volume 2.   \n",
      "Section 3: 2 \tPURPOSE OF AN ESMP  The CESMP and OESMP include detailed sets of measures and procedures designed to ensure the implementation of the mitigation and monitoring measures, which have been outlined in Volume 2 of this Updated ESIA. These measures will be implemented at all stages of the project development, from construction, commissioning, and operation. It is noted that the ESMMP and its subsidiary CESMP and OESMP’s are living document and will be continually revised as necessary, or where specific changes occur on the site. A decommissioning plan for the proposed project will be prepared at an appropriate point of time in the future, in good time before decommissioning commences.  This Outline ESSMP indicates the environmental and social management structure, which will be responsible for implementing the procedures of the CESMP and OESMP; including recommended organisation structure and roles and responsibilities of team members.  The CESMP and OESMP are specific in nature and will be amended and configured prior to and during all phases as circumstances or activities change on site. This Outline ESMMP includes framework measures designed to ensure and assess the long-term effectiveness of the project’s environmental and social mitigation measures defined in the Volume 2 of the Updated ESIA, as follows:  Program of audits and inspections;  Procedure for recording and reporting environmental and social incidents;  Procedures for recording complaints regarding environmental and social issues;  System for liaising with the environmental regulatory authorities;  Procedures for regular review of the effectiveness of the CESMP and OESMP; and  \tProgram for environmental and social monitoring. \n",
      "Section 4: 2.1 \tObjectives of Environmental & Social Management and Monitoring Plans  The main objective of ESMMPs is to ensure that the various adverse impacts associated with the project are properly mitigated and managed. The objective of the ESMMP at various stages of the project planning and implementation are as follows:  Construction Phase  To prevent and reduce the negative environmental and social impacts of the project by implementation of approved mitigation & management measures defined by the Updated ESIA; and  To ensure that the provisions of the CESMP are strictly followed and implemented, maintained and regularly improved through effective monitoring.  Operational Phase  To prevent or minimise the deterioration of environmental and social parameter through the implementation of approved mitigation & management measures defined by the updated ESIA; and  To ensure that the provisions of the OESMP are strictly followed and implemented maintained and regularly improved through effective monitoring. \n",
      "Section 5: 2.2 \tEnvironmental and Social Management Plan Policy/Requirements  Jordanian  ‘The Environmental Management Plan (EMP), in accordance with Annex 5 of EIA Regulation No.37 of 2005 (Jordan, 2005a), is a separate report from the EIA document that should address each activity at the facility for all phases of the project (construction, operation, and decommissioning) to which an environmental limitation or other requirement applies or for which a mitigation measure will be implemented. The EMP is a stand-alone document that will be a “living document” for use during inspections that should be continually updated as needed as the project goes to construction, operation and long-term monitoring. This document must provide sufficient information for the inspection department to use during the inspection process.’   (Source: Jordan Ministry of Environment, Guidance for Preparing Environmental Impact  Assessments)   Lender Requirements  EBRD  The following is referenced from EBRD Performance Requirement 1 in regard to Environmental and Social Management Plans:  ‘Taking into account the findings of the environmental and social assessment process and the outcomes of stakeholder engagement, the client will develop and implement a programme of actions to address the identified project’s environmental and social impacts and issues and other performance improvement measures to meet the PRs. Depending on the project, the programme may consist of a combination of documented operational policies, management systems, procedures, plans, practices and capital investments, collectively known as Environmental and Social Management Plans (ESMPs).   The ESMP will reflect the mitigation hierarchy and, where technically and financially feasible, favour the avoidance and prevention of impacts over minimisation, mitigation or compensation, and ensure that all relevant stages of the project are structured to meet applicable  laws and regulatory requirements and the PRs. Where affected individuals or groups are identified as disadvantaged or vulnerable during the appraisal process, the ESMP will include differentiated measures so that adverse impacts do not fall disproportionately on them and they are able to take advantage of opportunities to bene t from the project. Where relevant, the ESMP will also cover management of third party and supply chain issues.   The level of detail and complexity of the ESMP will be commensurate with the project’s impacts and issues addressing risks, impacts and opportunities specific to the project. The ESMP will de ne desired outcomes as measurable events to the extent possible with elements such as targets and performance indicators that can be tracked over de ned periods. Recognising the dynamic nature of the project development and implementation process, the ESMPs will be responsive to changes in project circumstances, unforeseen events, regulatory changes and the results of monitoring and review, and will be updated from time to time.    The ESMS, including any specific requirements and actions it sets out, will apply to the project regardless of whether it is carried out directly by the client or through contractors or subcontractors. It is the client’s responsibility to ensure that contractors working on project sites meet these requirements by adopting and implementing an appropriate contractor management system. Effective contractor management includes:    assessing environmental and social risks associated with contracted works and services and incorporating relevant ESMP conditions into tender documents as appropriate, contractually requiring contractors to apply these standards and provide for mitigation of non-compliance   overseeing that contractors have the knowledge and skills to perform their project tasks in accordance with the contract conditions   monitoring contractor compliance with the contract conditions   in the case of subcontracting, requiring contractors to have similar arrangements with their subcontractors.   Requirements related to labour and working conditions of non-employee workers are outlined in PR 2. Requirements on occupational health and safety of all workers are in PR 4.’    IFC  In regard to management plans, IFC Performance Standard 1 outlines the following:  ‘The management programs will establish environmental and social Action Plans*, which will define desired outcomes and actions to address the issues raised in the risks and impacts identification process, as measurable events to the extent possible, with elements such as performance indicators, targets, or acceptance criteria that can be tracked over defined time periods, and with estimates of the resources and responsibilities for implementation. As appropriate, the management program will recognize and incorporate the role of relevant actions and events controlled by third parties to address identified risks and impacts. Recognizing the dynamic nature of the project, the management program will be responsive to changes in circumstances, unforeseen events, and the results of monitoring and review.‘  A relevant footnote (denoted by the asterix) explains:  ‘*Action plans may include an overall Environmental and Social Action Plan necessary for carrying out a suite of mitigation measures or thematic action plans, such as Resettlement Action Plans or Biodiversity Action Plans. Action plans may be plans designed to fill in the gaps of existing management programs to ensure consistency with the Performance Standards, or they may be stand alone plans that specify the project’s mitigation strategy.  The “Action plan” terminology is understood by some communities of practice to mean Management plans, or Development plans. In this case, examples are numerous and include various types of environmental and social management plans.’  Besides the above, the IFC PS1 continues to outline the expected contents of management programs, which should include, but not be limited to: On-going Monitoring, Emergency Preparedness, Stakeholder Engagement, External Communications and Grievance Mechanism, Reporting.   \t \n",
      "Section 6: 3 \tCESMP REQUIREMENTS  In order to ensure compliance with environmental legislation, both national and international, the Construction Environmental and Social Management Plan (CESMP) will be developed to manage environmental risks during the construction phase. The final CESMP will need to be prepared by the EPC and all sub-contractors before construction works commence will be obliged to adhere to its contents. This also includes following and enacting proper management structures and procedures.  The key benefits of a CESMP are to:   Provide the organisation structure and responsibility to manage the environmental and social components of the projects construction;  Provide a commitment that the approved (MoE and lender approved) mitigation and monitoring measures are implemented on the site;  Provide a system to monitor environmental and social performance of the project against baseline conditions;  Provide a system for the formal identification of potential environmental and social impacts associated with construction processes; and  Enable the identification of objectives and targets.  The CESMP will be required to cover all construction components of the proposed ACWA Power Zarqa CCGT project and will provide detailed mitigation, management and monitoring for individual activities. The purpose of these is to reduce the severity of impacts during construction of the Project through avoidance, prevention, reduction and rectification.   The actions to be set out in the CESMP are intended to act as a tool for anticipating, recording and ameliorating any potential or actual impacts that may arise. In this regard, the CESMP will be designed to specify timing and technical aspects of optimising or reducing positive and negative impacts, respectively and will evolve as the projects construction progresses to ensure that its content reflects the current construction programme.  As a more practical approach, the specific requirements of the CESMP will be updated in accordance with the developing stages of construction.  Managers and supervisors for all parties on site (EPC and sub-contractors) are responsible for providing assurance that their work unit is following the CESMP.  Including actions in the work method statements and conducting regular audits of the management system can achieve this.  A documented auditable trail will be established for verification purposes and should be available in the site-offices.   The content of this chapter will be used as a basic structure to provide a foundation upon which the development of a CESMP can be achieved. The following chapter describes the anticipated key contents of the full CESMP. \n",
      "Section 7: 3.1 \tSite Description and Existing Conditions  The CESMP will be required to include the following:   \tLocation of the Project, including a site plan, showing construction site boundaries;  \tPosition of the project in relation to any sensitive receptors identified in the ESIA; and  \tAccess roads to the sites. \n",
      "Section 8: 3.2 \tDescription of the Construction Works  The CESMP will provide a detailed programme of the construction activities of the CCGT project and will include, as a minimum:  Proposed dates and sequences of the planned works with relation to the environmental and social issues outlined within this report in order to minimise disturbances to the local communities;  Details of proposed normal working hours and intended start up and close down times;  List of the equipment to be used;  List of required equipment and site services such as water supply, sanitation, solid waste facilities, power supply, etc;  Details of the storage facilities required, e.g. for fuels, hazardous substances, chemicals, etc. and describe the method and minimum requirements for building these storage facilities;  Vehicle access routes/points;  Methods of the delivery/removal of materials/wastes and equipment;  Details of proposed site accommodation; and  Location of storage facilities for pipe sections, tools, equipment, chemicals etc. \n",
      "Section 9: 3.3 \tEnvironmental Management Staff: Roles and Responsibilities  The HSE Management structure during construction is presented below and will operate on a top down structure from ACWA Power in order to use the wider ACWA Power policies as the basis for all project related HSE and HR policies for ACWA Power Zarqa and SEPCO III.  Figure 3-1 Construction HSE Management Structure    ACWA Power Zarqa will employ 6 staff during construction. This will include:  1 CEO;  1 Project Director;  1 CFO;  2 Accountants;  1 Public Relations Manager;    Additional staff not listed above include those from the Owners Engineer (Poyry) and those from CEGCO who will work with ACWA Power Zarqa under the O&M Agreement. The staff from Poyry and CEGCO (under the O&M Agreement) can effectively be considered part of the project company.   The proposed structure of ACWA Power Zarqa during construction (for staff stemming from the Project Director) is shown below, with staff included from the owner’s engineers (Poyry) and those associated with o CEGCO, under the O&M Agreement.  Figure 3-2 ACWA Power Zarqa Staff Organogram      As per the above staff organogram, ACWA Power Zarqa’s staffing structure includes a HSE Manager and HSE team. The HSE Manager and Team are provided by CEGCO under the  O&M Agreement and will oversee HSE on behalf of the project company, ACWA Power Zarqa. This HSE team will oversee SEPCO III’s dedicated HSE Team on-site. Both HSE teams will be subject to co-ordination and inspection by ACWA Power Corporate HSE personnel.  The CESMP will further present documentation detailing the management structure encompassing all staff responsible for environmental work. The CESMP will need to define the respective roles and responsibilities with regard to the environment and identify the site’s responsible Environmental Manager. Descriptions of individual environmental team responsibilities are outlined below and should not be limited to, the following team members. All personnel on site are responsible for protecting the environment and community by ensuring that appropriate protection measures are implemented as per the CESMP.  Table 3-1 Proposed Roles and Responsibilities of the EPC Contractor Team (including subcontractors and visitors)     Resources   All levels of management, an in particular the Project Company, are accountable to ensure that the necessary resources are available for implementing and accomplishing environmental and social responsibilities as per the CESMP.  Therefore, the following issues will be provided and assured:  Appointed Environmental & Social Manager (and assistants) will be competent and experienced in the relevant issues;  Suitable time will be allocated to manage these issues;   Environmental and Community awareness training will be provided;    Suitable documentation will be provided;   Appropriate equipment will be appropriated; and  Suitable budget will be allocated for managing environmental and social incidents.   \n",
      "Section 10: 3.4 \tApplicable Legislation, Policy and Environmental/Social Principles  Regulatory Authorities   The Jordanian Ministry of Environment have the regulatory responsibility to ensure the project is executed in accordance with national legislation. Routine site inspections may be carried out by representative officers from the MoE in order to conduct compliance audits.  The same may be expected by the lenders and any appointed lenders independent advisors (further information regarding independent auditing is provided later in this volume).  The CESMP will need to include a section that:  Specifies the overall policy statement for the project that may include aspects such as environmental induction training for all contractors, subcontractors and staff and other social, health and safety aspects.  Identifies the applicable national and international legislative requirements, guidelines and standards such as legislation in relation to pollution control, endangered species, hazardous waste standards, contaminated land, heritage and archaeology, and employment and social rights issues.  Describes a grievance redress mechanism that should be implemented during the construction of the project.   To ensure compliance with applicable laws and standards it is recommended that the project documents all applicable laws, regulations and standards.  \n",
      "Section 11: 3.5 \tEnvironmental/Social Requirements and Compliance  The CESMP will cover compliance requirements, monitoring and auditing procedures, roles and responsibilities and remedial actions.  The CESMP will be submitted to the Ministry of Environment (MoE) for review and approval  The CESMP will also be submitted to the international lenders and reviewed by its independent environmental and social advisors. If required, a corrective action plan will be developed accordingly.  The CESMP will include the requirements set out in the approval permit. It will therefore include:  Procedures for monitoring construction processes against the national and international standards and with regard to the project environmental and social objectives; and  Procedures for dealing with major pollution or other environmental incidents that could unexpectedly occur during the construction phase (including timeline and the notification/reporting to the relevant authorities as well as the international lenders) and which are particularly related to air quality (e.g. dust), ecology (e.g. protected fauna/flora), ground/soil quality (contamination issues), noise and vibration, water resources, waste management, cultural heritage (e.g. archaeological finds) and land access issues. \n",
      "Section 12: 3.6 \tEnvironmental/Social Training and Awareness Program  Training and awareness programmes are an extremely important part of the CESMP and of the overall project development. All staff and labourers working on site will be required to attend an environmental/social awareness and training program as part of their site induction, prior to commencing work, which will include:  Induction training for general environmental and social awareness and the content of the CESMP;  Site induction training that will highlight the specific environmental (and health safety requirements described in a separate specialist framework management plan) requirements and activities being undertaken at the worksite including hours of operation, noise and vibration limits, necessary mitigation & management measures, soil and water control measures, sensitive receptors and local community issues, traffic access, site entrance and exits etc.;   Dealing with and handling hazardous and non-hazardous wastes;  The importance of waste recycling and associated procedures;  Training on the emergency preparedness and response plan (as prepared by EPC);  Training on incident notification, investigation and reporting;   \tTraining for traffic monitoring and management; and  \tInduction training for construction site visitors.  It is recommended that this be incorporated with a safety training programme, which will also be required for all employees working on the CCGT project site.  \n",
      "Section 13: 3.7 \tIdentifying the Environmental and Social Issues  A summary of the environmental/social issues and aspects will be included within the CESMP and prepared based on the findings and various risks identified in the Updated ESIA. This summary will be updated to reflect any additional risks resulting from the contractors/subcontractors selected methods of working, changes in site conditions, changes in program, and changes in design.   Given the nature of the project and as per the social and environmental assessment, risks would be identified within the CESMP, which would include the categories for the environmental and social aspects outlined within the Updated ESIA. \n",
      "Section 14: 3.8 \tMonitoring, Recording, Inspection and Auditing Program  Daily inspections of work areas by the EPC Contractor Supervisor and weekly inspections as a minimum by the Environmental/Social Manager will also need to be conducted to identify any issues or non-compliance with the CESMP and to monitor the daily work practices.    A weekly inspection checklist will be prepared and will be provided to the External Auditors for evaluation, which will involve all the subcontractors to discuss environmental and social issues and their rectifications.  Independent audits need to be undertaken quarterly by an external consultant to ensure that the lenders can receive periodic updates regarding the environmental and social performance of the project. Such audits will check the following:   Compliance with applicable national standards and regulatory requirements (including lender requirements), as per the CESMP and site-specific procedures/method statements;  Checks on site works, monitoring records, inspection checklists, and other relevant documentation;  Identification and documentation of non-conformances,  \tIdentifying the requirements for corrective actions.   The outcomes of the audit will be documented including non-conformances, recommendations and corrective actions. \n",
      "Section 15: 3.9 \tCommunication and Grievances  Communication, both internally and externally, are an important aspect of successful project delivery. Internal communication include arranging regular meetings for the Project team to review and co-ordinate project progress with regards to environmental and community issues.   Public Communication Program   The Project developer will prepare and implement a Public Communication Program to provide ongoing information to the affected Stakeholders and general public on the key relevant environmental and social aspects throughout the construction phase. This program will build upon the Stakeholder Engagement Plan (SEP) to be prepared separately to the Updated ESIA, and will utilise mass media, bulletins and other communication forms to communicate and consult with affected Stakeholders.   The main actions of the Public Communication Program are:  Timely and appropriate provision of information to the local communities prior to and during the construction activities (directly by Project developer and/or through the Construction Contractors).  Twice yearly update of the project status by the Project developer to the local communities.  Provision of specific information on an as need basis, should any significant changes in the project planning occur, which may affect certain Stakeholders (e.g. realignment of access roads, or change of construction schedule).  The Public Communication Program will be coupled with the Grievance Mechanism, which provides Stakeholders a way to formally register any complaints/ grievances to the project developer about the Project’s environmental and social performance. Such a mechanism will include a signboard along the projects boundary which will provide the contact numbers/details of the Project Team, in order for the local community to be able to contact them.  The grievance mechanism seeks to resolve concerns promptly, using a transparent process that is culturally appropriate and readily accessible at no cost and without retribution to the party that originated the issue or concern. The mechanism covers any type of complaint whatever the subject and nature, and will include the following steps:  All grievances will be logged (by methods outlined in the SEP) and reviewed by the Environmental & Social Manager.   The Site Environmental & Social Manager will identify the mechanism to redress the grievance, will identify the party responsible for accomplishing the task and will issue the instruction to complete the action.   The site Environmental & Social Manager will review the adequacy of the action and approve the completion of the action.  All steps of the process will be logged in the Grievance register and the relevant environmental issue of the CESMP will be updated accordingly (i.e. monitoring, training, material supplies, budgeting, staffing… etc).  The Grievance Mechanism will be updated as appropriate during the project lifecycle. The EPC Contractor will also be required to implement a Grievance Mechanism to address as efficiently and directly as possible any complaints from the stakeholders. \n",
      "Section 16: 3.10 Document Control and Review  All documents relevant to the CESMP will be controlled onsite. The controlled documents include the CESMP report, procedures, audit reports, incident reports, records, and community complaints.

      "Section 17: 3.11 Mitigation & Management Measures, Regulations and Procedures  This Outline ESMMP recommends mitigation & management measures for the identified potential environmental and social impacts at the construction phase, as identified in the Updated ESIA Volume 2.   Design phase mitigation measures have also been recommended for consideration during the detailed design of the projects various facilities. Typically, the recommendations involve the use of pollution control technologies to minimise the environmental and social impacts.  The mitigation & management measures presented have been developed from Best Management Practices (BMP) source controls and engineering controls.   It will be noted that the measures outlined in the relevant chapter of the Updated ESIA (Volume 2) will also be implemented in addition to the ones listed in the following sections.   The overall effectiveness of the mitigation & management measures will be assessed by site monitoring programs, which will be implemented during the construction and operation phases of the project. The monitoring activities will also be designed to evaluate the project’s compliance against environmental and social guidelines.  Emergency Preparedness and Response Planning  A key plan that needs to be developed in line with the CESMP is the ‘Emergency  Preparedness and Response Plan’. This plan is of particular importance for the ACWA Power Zarqa CCGT project due to the location of the project in an existing industrial area of Zarqa in very close proximity to other industrial facilities, such as the Petrochemical refinery and the decommissioned Hussein TPS HFO plant.  It is understood that CEGCO have an existing emergency preparedness and response plan in place for the HTPS HFO Plant, which is likely to incorporate a significant amount of important and site/area specific detail regarding potential emergency situations. The EPC Contractors site specific Emergency Preparedness and Response plan shall be developed in co-ordination with the existing plan as a minimum. Further to this, the plan shall be consistent with any plans available locally or those in place at other facilities (i.e. where wider emergencies from the petrochemical refinery could have an impacts upon the project site).   Where potential emergencies from the proposed project may put local communities and other commerce at risk, the projects plan shall include mechanisms for notification, assistance and evacuation (if necessary) of any local areas.  The plan must include specific contact details (Site Manager, HSE Manager, Site Nurse etc.), including a contact hierarchy in case of emergency, including details of external agencies who may assist (e.g. Civil Defence, Healthcare services) in response or who should otherwise be notified (Government, NEPCO etc.).  The plan shall include mechanisms to ensure suitable and sufficient emergency response equipment is on-site for reasonably foreseeable risks, and that the personnel on-site are suitably trained in regard to using this equipment and response to the plan. The plan shall include mechanisms to ensure regular drills/training are undertaken in like with the plan specifically.   The plan shall be displayed around site, presented in inductions, included to training and implemented as required. Specifically, the plan shall include a mechanism to communicate its key points to potential stakeholders of concern off-site (e.g. local residences, industry and commerce). Methods of communication shall be consistent with the Stakeholder Engagement Plan (SEP). The Emergency Preparedness and Response Plan shall be updated periodically and reviewed at least once a year.

      "Section 18: 4 \tOESMP REQUIREMENTS  The Operational Environmental & Social Management and Monitoring Plan (OESMP) will serve as the key tool for managing environmental and social aspects related to the operation processes of the ACWA Power Zarqa CCGT Project. The following chapter provides a framework for the preparation of the site-specific OESMP by the O&M Company. It is recommended that the OESMP be finalised, 2 months prior to the start of operations. \n",
      "Section 19: 4.1 \tOperational \tEnvironmental \tand \tSocial \tManagement \tPlan \t(OESMP) Requirements  The OESMP establishes mechanisms for the identification and implementation of environmental and social protection, mitigation, monitoring and institutional measures that will be taken during the operational phase of the proposed project. Such measure will be implemented to ensure compliance to the Jordanian standards and lender requirements respective for the project. All currently applicable regulation and standards for the project are detailed in Volume 2 of the Updated ESIA.  The purpose of preparing and implementing the OESMP is to ensure necessary mitigation to manage the potential adverse environmental and social impacts associated with the operation of the proposed project to acceptable levels (or to ameliorate positive impacts).  The OESMP will also need to identity the objectives, specify the monitoring requirements and measures which will include all the parameters required to be monitored, methods, sampling locations, measurement frequency, detection limits and the threshold where corrective actions are required (see section below).   The OESMP will be site specific and clearly state what issues are of specific relevance to the site.  It will need to:  Fulfil statutory requirements;  Highlight the applicable environmental guidelines, regulations/the legislative context;  Highlight the agreed social and community mitigation actions and awareness programs  Establish operational Environmental and Social Objectives;  List the identified Environmental and Social Aspects addressed in the Updated ESIA;  Develop and implement relevant procedures;  Develop a programme of continuous environmental and social improvement  Clearly specify roles and responsibilities; and  Highlight the procedures to be considered in the event of an environmental monitoring trigger level being breached or an unforeseen impact arising.  The OESMP will also identify the operational briefing and training requirements. Training can be provided in different forms such as induction sessions, training packs detailing good practices, or ‘toolbox talks’.  In addition, it is important for the OESMP to accommodate changes in conditions and respond to any need for further assessment requirements. Changes are most likely to arise if   I. A new environmental or social sensitivity is identified as a consequence of changing environmental and social conditions and more detailed survey work or  II. Changes are introduced to the installations/development design.  Documentation and communication protocols will also be required to be identified within the OESMP. Communication protocol will include   Incident/emergency communication procedure,  V. \tInternal communications, external communications,  VI. \tManagement of external/internal inquiries.   International good practice of ESMP structure details that the following items will be included: (source: Practitioner – Environmental Management Plan, Best Practice Series, The Institute of Environmental Management and Assessment, Vol. 12, December 2008):  Introduction – including summary of the project and aim of the OESMP;  Project team roles and responsibilities;  Summary of procedures – to be followed in the event of an emergency or breaching of OESMP measures;  Consents and permissions – this will provide a record of the consents with which the project is taking place;  Environmentally and Socially significant changes – detailed procedures to be followed if any significant changes are encountered once a project commences on the ground which would result in any changes to the OESMP;  Register of site-specific environmental actions and social initiatives – this information, forming the core of the document, will be detailed for each action/initiative; a tabular format is often used to provide clarity and ease of reference.  In addition, it will include (i) a programme that indicates when measures will be implemented and (ii) monitoring with indicators– to detail monitoring equipment/methods, schedule, frequency, guidelines and regulatory compliance;  Liaison and consultation requirements;  Register of variation – a tabular format document to record changes to procedures, design and mitigation and the implications of these changes and authorised personnel; and  Technical schedule – to provide further details on measures, e.g. monitoring methodologies to be followed, maps delineating boundaries/areas applicable to certain measures.  4.1.1 \tProcedural Mitigation Measures, Regulations and Procedure  The procedural measures during operation phase will be similar to the construction phase, but shall be specific for the operational phase. For instance, the Emergency Preparedness and Response Plan shall be aligned to operational risks, but shall implement similar mechanisms to those during construction.  Therefore, similar control techniques and mitigation & management measures will be in place to tackle such risks. These typically include the use of pollution control technologies to minimise the environmental impacts and community awareness and integration initiatives.  The mitigation & management measures presented have been developed from Best Management Practices (BMP) source controls and engineering controls.   It will also be noted that mitigation & management measures outlined in the Updated ESIA (Volume 2) will also be implemented and included in the OESMP wherever necessary.   The overall effectiveness of the mitigation & management measures will be assessed by site monitoring programs, which will be implemented during the operation phases of the project. The monitoring activities will also be designed to evaluate the project’s compliance against environmental guidelines and community awareness initiatives.   \n",
      "Section 20: 5 \tMITIGATION & MANAGEMENT MEASURES   This chapter includes the mitigation & management measures to address the potential impacts outlined in Volume 2 of the Updated ESIA. The mitigation & management measures detailed are consistent with those in Volume 2, but indicate responsibility and timeline for implementation.  Volume 2 of this Updated ESIA outlines the specific standards that require compliance in regard to the Jordanian and lender requirements. The applicable legislation is detailed for Jordan, and where specific lender standards/guideline exist, these have also been included to the following tables.  With regards to cost, it should be noted that the majority of the recommended mitigation measures relate to integrating appropriate management strategies and work practices.  Therefore very few of the proposed mitigation strategies require the purchase of additional materials or the construction of additional structures that have not been already integrated in the design and operation activities.  \n",

      "Section 27: 6.1 \tIntroduction  The objective of an environmental monitoring plan is to establish the baseline indicators to assess the overall performance and effectiveness of the environmental management programs. A monitoring program has the underlying objective of ensuring that the intended environmental mitigations are realised and that minimal deterioration occurs to the environmental parameters. The environmental monitoring program will aid management in redefining the environmental program objectives and where necessary, re-allocate the budget for implementing pollution control systems, employees’ awareness and training programs, implementing pollution prevention opportunities etc. The broad objectives of the Environmental Monitoring Plan are:  To evaluate the performance of mitigation & management measures proposed in the ESMP;  To evaluate the adequacy of Environmental Assessment;  To suggest ongoing improvements in the management plan based on the monitoring and to devise fresh monitoring on the basis of the improved ESMP;  To enhance environmental quality through proper implementation of suggested mitigation & management measures; and  To meet the requirements of the existing environmental regulatory guidelines and community obligations.  The detailed monitoring plan strategy will be determined in consultation with the Ministry of Environment and the lending banks, and will enable the ACWA Power Zarqa CCGT Project to comply with regulatory requirements for monitoring during the operational phase and in order to monitor environmental aspects during the construction stage.  Monitoring data will be analysed and reviewed at regular intervals and compared with the operating standards so that any necessary corrective actions can be taken.   Additional guidance on applicable sampling and analytical methods for emissions and effluents that will be considered is provided in the IFC’s General EHS Guidelines (2007).  Based on the mitigation recommendations in the Updated ESIA, the following environmental parameters will be monitored.  It should be noted that this table is a summary only, and the details of the methods, parameters and frequencies are provided in the subsequent discussion.  A general monitoring plan for the proposed project is also suggested in the following sections. It is suggested to incorporate these in individual monitoring plans developed during construction and operation phase.   All monitoring results will be recorded in the site Environmental Monitoring Program register.  6.1.1 \tMonitoring Program for Construction Phase  The construction phase compliance monitoring will be carried out on a regular basis, using various techniques and at different intervals, by various parties. This will ensure that all activities are carried out in compliance with existing local and international standards and according to the proposed CESMP. Recommended construction phase monitoring activities are described below. These monitoring activities are to be finalised by the EPC as part of the Construction – Environmental & Social Monitoring Plan.   ACWA Power Zarqa CCGT Project  Updated ESIA - Volume 3, July 2016 (ISSUE 3) \t \t65      6.1.2 \tMonitoring Program for Operation Phase  The monitoring program during the operation phase provides a means of validation of the implementation and effectiveness of the mitigation & management measures incorporated in the ACWA Power Zarqa CCGT Project and developed during the Updated ESIA process, while allowing residual impacts to be predicted. This information can be used to refine the existing mitigation and, if necessary, aid in the development of additional mitigation and management measures. These monitoring activities are to be finalised by the O&M Company as part of the Operational – Environmental & Social Monitoring Plan.  6.1.3 \tMethods  Compliance monitoring will be conducted through regular environmental inspections, audits, control feed-back mechanisms, document control, and reviews to check if activities and operations are in compliance with proposed Jordanian standards and lender requirements.  Environmental compliance monitoring will be carried out on several different levels, namely:  Site personnel will make general observations from their day to day activities in regard to general monitoring and monitoring detailed in the mitigation plan for ‘as required/daily/general’;  The on-site team will have specific inspection programmes upon which monitoring for a checklist of parameters can be assessed visually or by equipment in place on a rapid basis, against a set checklist;  Site personnel guided by the Environment & Social Manager will conduct continuous and/or field and laboratory monitoring of physical measurements (e.g. air, water, noise);  The project is required to report to the lenders through periodic independent updates (construction and operation). An independent environmental consultant will be engaged to undertake such audits, in line with the CESMP /OESMP to monitor project compliance against Jordanian standards and lender requirements.   If any non-compliance is found during any of control mechanisms, the adequate correction measures will be taken. Each non-compliance will be followed-up by an investigation which will be carried out to identify sources and/or reasons for non-compliance. Based on follow up investigation results, adequate prevention measures will be implemented to ensure that non compliance will not reoccur. \n",
      "Section 28: 6.2 \tMonitoring Plan Template  The following table is a very basic template design to help develop a more detailed procedure and reporting format.  The government authorities will also provide the outline of the format and content of a monitoring plan that will be used for regulatory reporting purposes.  In order to simplify the process, it is best to therefore adopt the regulatory authorities monitoring report template, in order to avoid duplication of works.  Furthermore, the regulatory authority will provide further input to the content and methodology as is fitting to the project needs and phases of construction and operation.

Depending on the project, the programme may consist of a combination of documented operational policies, management systems, procedures, plans, practices and capital investments, collectively known as Environmental and Social Management Plans (ESMPs).   The ESMP will reflect the mitigation hierarchy and, where technically and financially feasible, favour the avoidance and prevention of impacts over minimisation, mitigation or compensation, and ensure that all relevant stages of the project are structured to meet applicable  laws and regulatory requirements and the PRs. Where affected individuals or groups are identified as disadvantaged or vulnerable during the appraisal process, the ESMP will include differentiated measures so that adverse impacts do not fall disproportionately on them and they are able to take advantage of opportunities to bene t from the project. Where relevant, the ESMP will also cover management of third party and supply chain issues.   The level of detail and complexity of the ESMP will be commensurate with the project’s impacts and issues addressing risks, impacts and opportunities specific to the project. The ESMP will de ne desired outcomes as measurable events to the extent possible with elements such as targets and performance indicators that can be tracked over de ned periods. Recognising the dynamic nature of the project development and implementation process, the ESMPs will be responsive to changes in project circumstances, unforeseen events, regulatory changes and the results of monitoring and review, and will be updated from time to time.    The ESMS, including any specific requirements and actions it sets out, will apply to the project regardless of whether it is carried out directly by the client or through contractors or subcontractors. It is the client’s responsibility to ensure that contractors working on project sites meet these requirements by adopting and implementing an appropriate contractor management system. Effective contractor management includes:    assessing environmental and social risks associated with contracted works and services and incorporating relevant ESMP conditions into tender documents as appropriate, contractually requiring contractors to apply these standards and provide for mitigation of non-compliance   overseeing that contractors have the knowledge and skills to perform their project tasks in accordance with the contract conditions   monitoring contractor compliance with the contract conditions   in the case of subcontracting, requiring contractors to have similar arrangements with their subcontractors.   Requirements related to labour and working conditions of non-employee workers are outlined in PR 2. Requirements on occupational health and safety of all workers are in PR 4.’    IFC  In regard to management plans, IFC Performance Standard 1 outlines the following:  ‘The management programs will establish environmental and social Action Plans*, which will define desired outcomes and actions to address the issues raised in the risks and impacts identification process, as measurable events to the extent possible, with elements such as performance indicators, targets, or acceptance criteria that can be tracked over defined time periods, and with estimates of the resources and responsibilities for implementation. As appropriate, the management program will recognize and incorporate the role of relevant actions and events controlled by third parties to address identified risks and impacts. Recognizing the dynamic nature of the project, the management program will be responsive to changes in circumstances, unforeseen events, and the results of monitoring and review.‘  A relevant footnote (denoted by the asterix) explains:  ‘*Action plans may include an overall Environmental and Social Action Plan necessary for carrying out a suite of mitigation measures or thematic action plans, such as Resettlement Action Plans or Biodiversity Action Plans. Action plans may be plans designed to fill in the gaps of existing management programs to ensure consistency with the Performance Standards, or they may be stand alone plans that specify the project’s mitigation strategy.  The “Action plan” terminology is understood by some communities of practice to mean Management plans, or Development plans. In this case, examples are numerous and include various types of environmental and social management plans.’  Besides the above, the IFC PS1 continues to outline the expected contents of management programs, which should include, but not be limited to: On-going Monitoring, Emergency Preparedness, Stakeholder Engagement, External Communications and Grievance Mechanism, Reporting.   \t \n"

      "Section 2: 1 \tINTRODUCTION  This Outline Environmental & Social Management and Monitoring Plan (ESMMP) has been prepared as part of the Updated ESIA for the 485MW ACWA Power Zarqa CCGT Project being developed by ACWA Power Zarqa (the Project Company). This document is Volume 3 of the Updated ESIA and provides detailed environmental and social actions and initiatives that will be developed within the EPC contractors CESMP and the Operational & Maintenance Company’s OESMP, and will therefore be implemented during the construction and operational phases of the project.  This plan is a requirement of the  Jordanian Ministry of Environment and the projects lending institutions (notably EBRD and IFC).  As the information included to this Outline ESSMP is for use by the EPC Contractor (i.e. SEPCO III Electric Power Construction Corporation (SEPCO III)) and the O&M Company (i.e. Central Electrical Generating Company (CEGCO)) to develop their project specific CESMP and OESMP, the mention of any further management plans is intended as a guide for such documents to be prepared by the EPC or O&M respectively. Such documents must be prepared on a site-specific basis and must be relevant to the SEPCO III, any subcontractors  and CEGCO personnel, any specific external agencies and other stakeholders.  The action items proposed in the ESMMP are the minimum requirements that the contractors and operators must follow during construction and operation and are consistent with the mitigation and monitoring activities outlined in the Updated ESIA Volume 2.   \n",
      "Section 3: 2 \tPURPOSE OF AN ESMP  The CESMP and OESMP include detailed sets of measures and procedures designed to ensure the implementation of the mitigation and monitoring measures, which have been outlined in Volume 2 of this Updated ESIA. These measures will be implemented at all stages of the project development, from construction, commissioning, and operation. It is noted that the ESMMP and its subsidiary CESMP and OESMP’s are living document and will be continually revised as necessary, or where specific changes occur on the site. A decommissioning plan for the proposed project will be prepared at an appropriate point of time in the future, in good time before decommissioning commences.  This Outline ESSMP indicates the environmental and social management structure, which will be responsible for implementing the procedures of the CESMP and OESMP; including recommended organisation structure and roles and responsibilities of team members.  The CESMP and OESMP are specific in nature and will be amended and configured prior to and during all phases as circumstances or activities change on site. This Outline ESMMP includes framework measures designed to ensure and assess the long-term effectiveness of the project’s environmental and social mitigation measures defined in the Volume 2 of the Updated ESIA, as follows:  Program of audits and inspections;  Procedure for recording and reporting environmental and social incidents;  Procedures for recording complaints regarding environmental and social issues;  System for liaising with the environmental regulatory authorities;  Procedures for regular review of the effectiveness of the CESMP and OESMP; and  \tProgram for environmental and social monitoring. \n",
      "Section 4: 2.1 \tObjectives of Environmental & Social Management and Monitoring Plans  The main objective of ESMMPs is to ensure that the various adverse impacts associated with the project are properly mitigated and managed. The objective of the ESMMP at various stages of the project planning and implementation are as follows: \n",
      "Section 5: Construction Phase  To prevent and reduce the negative environmental and social impacts of the project by implementation of approved mitigation & management measures defined by the Updated ESIA; and  To ensure that the provisions of the CESMP are strictly followed and implemented, maintained and regularly improved through effective monitoring. \n",
      "Section 6: Operational Phase  To prevent or minimise the deterioration of environmental and social parameter through the implementation of approved mitigation & management measures defined by the updated ESIA; and  To ensure that the provisions of the OESMP are strictly followed and implemented maintained and regularly improved through effective monitoring. \n",
      "Section 7: 2.2 \tEnvironmental and Social Management Plan Policy/Requirements \n",
      "Section 8: Jordanian  ‘The Environmental Management Plan (EMP), in accordance with Annex 5 of EIA Regulation No.37 of 2005 (Jordan, 2005a), is a separate report from the EIA document that should address each activity at the facility for all phases of the project (construction, operation, and decommissioning) to which an environmental limitation or other requirement applies or for which a mitigation measure will be implemented. The EMP is a stand-alone document that will be a “living document” for use during inspections that should be continually updated as needed as the project goes to construction, operation and long-term monitoring. This document must provide sufficient information for the inspection department to use during the inspection process.’   (Source: Jordan Ministry of Environment, Guidance for Preparing Environmental Impact  Assessments)  \n",
      "Section 9: Lender Requirements  EBRD  The following is referenced from EBRD Performance Requirement 1 in regard to Environmental and Social Management Plans:  ‘Taking into account the findings of the environmental and social assessment process and the outcomes of stakeholder engagement, the client will develop and implement a programme of actions to address the identified project’s environmental and social impacts and issues and other performance improvement measures to meet the PRs. Depending on the project, the programme may consist of a combination of documented operational policies, management systems, procedures, plans, practices and capital investments, collectively known as Environmental and Social Management Plans (ESMPs).   The ESMP will reflect the mitigation hierarchy and, where technically and financially feasible, favour the avoidance and prevention of impacts over minimisation, mitigation or compensation, and ensure that all relevant stages of the project are structured to meet applicable  laws and regulatory requirements and the PRs. Where affected individuals or groups are identified as disadvantaged or vulnerable during the appraisal process, the ESMP will include differentiated measures so that adverse impacts do not fall disproportionately on them and they are able to take advantage of opportunities to bene t from the project. Where relevant, the ESMP will also cover management of third party and supply chain issues.   The level of detail and complexity of the ESMP will be commensurate with the project’s impacts and issues addressing risks, impacts and opportunities specific to the project. The ESMP will de ne desired outcomes as measurable events to the extent possible with elements such as targets and performance indicators that can be tracked over de ned periods. Recognising the dynamic nature of the project development and implementation process, the ESMPs will be responsive to changes in project circumstances, unforeseen events, regulatory changes and the results of monitoring and review, and will be updated from time to time.    The ESMS, including any specific requirements and actions it sets out, will apply to the project regardless of whether it is carried out directly by the client or through contractors or subcontractors. It is the client’s responsibility to ensure that contractors working on project sites meet these requirements by adopting and implementing an appropriate contractor management system. Effective contractor management includes:    assessing environmental and social risks associated with contracted works and services and incorporating relevant ESMP conditions into tender documents as appropriate, contractually requiring contractors to apply these standards and provide for mitigation of non-compliance   overseeing that contractors have the knowledge and skills to perform their project tasks in accordance with the contract conditions   monitoring contractor compliance with the contract conditions   in the case of subcontracting, requiring contractors to have similar arrangements with their subcontractors.   Requirements related to labour and working conditions of non-employee workers are outlined in PR 2. Requirements on occupational health and safety of all workers are in PR 4.’    IFC  In regard to management plans, IFC Performance Standard 1 outlines the following:  ‘The management programs will establish environmental and social Action Plans*, which will define desired outcomes and actions to address the issues raised in the risks and impacts identification process, as measurable events to the extent possible, with elements such as performance indicators, targets, or acceptance criteria that can be tracked over defined time periods, and with estimates of the resources and responsibilities for implementation. As appropriate, the management program will recognize and incorporate the role of relevant actions and events controlled by third parties to address identified risks and impacts. Recognizing the dynamic nature of the project, the management program will be responsive to changes in circumstances, unforeseen events, and the results of monitoring and review.‘  A relevant footnote (denoted by the asterix) explains:  ‘*Action plans may include an overall Environmental and Social Action Plan necessary for carrying out a suite of mitigation measures or thematic action plans, such as Resettlement Action Plans or Biodiversity Action Plans. Action plans may be plans designed to fill in the gaps of existing management programs to ensure consistency with the Performance Standards, or they may be stand alone plans that specify the project’s mitigation strategy.  The “Action plan” terminology is understood by some communities of practice to mean Management plans, or Development plans. In this case, examples are numerous and include various types of environmental and social management plans.’  Besides the above, the IFC PS1 continues to outline the expected contents of management programs, which should include, but not be limited to: On-going Monitoring, Emergency Preparedness, Stakeholder Engagement, External Communications and Grievance Mechanism, Reporting.   \t \n",
      "Section 10: 3 \tCESMP REQUIREMENTS  In order to ensure compliance with environmental legislation, both national and international, the Construction Environmental and Social Management Plan (CESMP) will be developed to manage environmental risks during the construction phase. The final CESMP will need to be prepared by the EPC and all sub-contractors before construction works commence will be obliged to adhere to its contents. This also includes following and enacting proper management structures and procedures.  The key benefits of a CESMP are to:   Provide the organisation structure and responsibility to manage the environmental and social components of the projects construction;  Provide a commitment that the approved (MoE and lender approved) mitigation and monitoring measures are implemented on the site;  Provide a system to monitor environmental and social performance of the project against baseline conditions;  Provide a system for the formal identification of potential environmental and social impacts associated with construction processes; and  Enable the identification of objectives and targets.  The CESMP will be required to cover all construction components of the proposed ACWA Power Zarqa CCGT project and will provide detailed mitigation, management and monitoring for individual activities. The purpose of these is to reduce the severity of impacts during construction of the Project through avoidance, prevention, reduction and rectification.   The actions to be set out in the CESMP are intended to act as a tool for anticipating, recording and ameliorating any potential or actual impacts that may arise. In this regard, the CESMP will be designed to specify timing and technical aspects of optimising or reducing positive and negative impacts, respectively and will evolve as the projects construction progresses to ensure that its content reflects the current construction programme.  As a more practical approach, the specific requirements of the CESMP will be updated in accordance with the developing stages of construction.  Managers and supervisors for all parties on site (EPC and sub-contractors) are responsible for providing assurance that their work unit is following the CESMP.  Including actions in the work method statements and conducting regular audits of the management system can achieve this.  A documented auditable trail will be established for verification purposes and should be available in the site-offices.   The content of this chapter will be used as a basic structure to provide a foundation upon which the development of a CESMP can be achieved. The following chapter describes the anticipated key contents of the full CESMP. \n",
      "Section 11: 3.1 \tSite Description and Existing Conditions  The CESMP will be required to include the following:   \tLocation of the Project, including a site plan, showing construction site boundaries;  \tPosition of the project in relation to any sensitive receptors identified in the ESIA; and  \tAccess roads to the sites. \n",
      "Section 12: 3.2 \tDescription of the Construction Works  The CESMP will provide a detailed programme of the construction activities of the CCGT project and will include, as a minimum:  Proposed dates and sequences of the planned works with relation to the environmental and social issues outlined within this report in order to minimise disturbances to the local communities;  Details of proposed normal working hours and intended start up and close down times;  List of the equipment to be used;  List of required equipment and site services such as water supply, sanitation, solid waste facilities, power supply, etc;  Details of the storage facilities required, e.g. for fuels, hazardous substances, chemicals, etc. and describe the method and minimum requirements for building these storage facilities;  Vehicle access routes/points;  Methods of the delivery/removal of materials/wastes and equipment;  Details of proposed site accommodation; and  Location of storage facilities for pipe sections, tools, equipment, chemicals etc. \n",
      "Section 13: 3.3 \tEnvironmental Management Staff: Roles and Responsibilities  The HSE Management structure during construction is presented below and will operate on a top down structure from ACWA Power in order to use the wider ACWA Power policies as the basis for all project related HSE and HR policies for ACWA Power Zarqa and SEPCO III. \n",
      "Section 14: Figure 3-1 Construction HSE Management Structure    ACWA Power Zarqa will employ 6 staff during construction. This will include:  1 CEO;  1 Project Director;  1 CFO;  2 Accountants;  1 Public Relations Manager;    Additional staff not listed above include those from the Owners Engineer (Poyry) and those from CEGCO who will work with ACWA Power Zarqa under the O&M Agreement. The staff from Poyry and CEGCO (under the O&M Agreement) can effectively be considered part of the project company.   The proposed structure of ACWA Power Zarqa during construction (for staff stemming from the Project Director) is shown below, with staff included from the owner’s engineers (Poyry) and those associated with o CEGCO, under the O&M Agreement. \n",
      "Section 15: Figure 3-2 ACWA Power Zarqa Staff Organogram      As per the above staff organogram, ACWA Power Zarqa’s staffing structure includes a HSE Manager and HSE team. The HSE Manager and Team are provided by CEGCO under the  O&M Agreement and will oversee HSE on behalf of the project company, ACWA Power Zarqa. This HSE team will oversee SEPCO III’s dedicated HSE Team on-site. Both HSE teams will be subject to co-ordination and inspection by ACWA Power Corporate HSE personnel.  The CESMP will further present documentation detailing the management structure encompassing all staff responsible for environmental work. The CESMP will need to define the respective roles and responsibilities with regard to the environment and identify the site’s responsible Environmental Manager. Descriptions of individual environmental team responsibilities are outlined below and should not be limited to, the following team members. All personnel on site are responsible for protecting the environment and community by ensuring that appropriate protection measures are implemented as per the CESMP. \n",
      "Section 16: Table 3-1 Proposed Roles and Responsibilities of the EPC Contractor Team (including subcontractors and visitors)    \n",
      "Section 17: Resources   All levels of management, an in particular the Project Company, are accountable to ensure that the necessary resources are available for implementing and accomplishing environmental and social responsibilities as per the CESMP.  Therefore, the following issues will be provided and assured:  Appointed Environmental & Social Manager (and assistants) will be competent and experienced in the relevant issues;  Suitable time will be allocated to manage these issues;   Environmental and Community awareness training will be provided;    Suitable documentation will be provided;   Appropriate equipment will be appropriated; and  Suitable budget will be allocated for managing environmental and social incidents.   \n",
      "Section 18: 3.4 \tApplicable Legislation, Policy and Environmental/Social Principles \n",
      "Section 19: Regulatory Authorities   The Jordanian Ministry of Environment have the regulatory responsibility to ensure the project is executed in accordance with national legislation. Routine site inspections may be carried out by representative officers from the MoE in order to conduct compliance audits.  The same may be expected by the lenders and any appointed lenders independent advisors (further information regarding independent auditing is provided later in this volume).  The CESMP will need to include a section that:  Specifies the overall policy statement for the project that may include aspects such as environmental induction training for all contractors, subcontractors and staff and other social, health and safety aspects.  Identifies the applicable national and international legislative requirements, guidelines and standards such as legislation in relation to pollution control, endangered species, hazardous waste standards, contaminated land, heritage and archaeology, and employment and social rights issues.  Describes a grievance redress mechanism that should be implemented during the construction of the project.   To ensure compliance with applicable laws and standards it is recommended that the project documents all applicable laws, regulations and standards.  \n",
      "Section 20: 3.5 \tEnvironmental/Social Requirements and Compliance  The CESMP will cover compliance requirements, monitoring and auditing procedures, roles and responsibilities and remedial actions.  The CESMP will be submitted to the Ministry of Environment (MoE) for review and approval  The CESMP will also be submitted to the international lenders and reviewed by its independent environmental and social advisors. If required, a corrective action plan will be developed accordingly.  The CESMP will include the requirements set out in the approval permit. It will therefore include:  Procedures for monitoring construction processes against the national and international standards and with regard to the project environmental and social objectives; and  Procedures for dealing with major pollution or other environmental incidents that could unexpectedly occur during the construction phase (including timeline and the notification/reporting to the relevant authorities as well as the international lenders) and which are particularly related to air quality (e.g. dust), ecology (e.g. protected fauna/flora), ground/soil quality (contamination issues), noise and vibration, water resources, waste management, cultural heritage (e.g. archaeological finds) and land access issues. \n",
      "Section 21: 3.6 \tEnvironmental/Social Training and Awareness Program  Training and awareness programmes are an extremely important part of the CESMP and of the overall project development. All staff and labourers working on site will be required to attend an environmental/social awareness and training program as part of their site induction, prior to commencing work, which will include:  Induction training for general environmental and social awareness and the content of the CESMP;  Site induction training that will highlight the specific environmental (and health safety requirements described in a separate specialist framework management plan) requirements and activities being undertaken at the worksite including hours of operation, noise and vibration limits, necessary mitigation & management measures, soil and water control measures, sensitive receptors and local community issues, traffic access, site entrance and exits etc.;   Dealing with and handling hazardous and non-hazardous wastes;  The importance of waste recycling and associated procedures;  Training on the emergency preparedness and response plan (as prepared by EPC);  Training on incident notification, investigation and reporting;   \tTraining for traffic monitoring and management; and  \tInduction training for construction site visitors.  It is recommended that this be incorporated with a safety training programme, which will also be required for all employees working on the CCGT project site.  \n",
      "Section 22: 3.7 \tIdentifying the Environmental and Social Issues  A summary of the environmental/social issues and aspects will be included within the CESMP and prepared based on the findings and various risks identified in the Updated ESIA. This summary will be updated to reflect any additional risks resulting from the contractors/subcontractors selected methods of working, changes in site conditions, changes in program, and changes in design.   Given the nature of the project and as per the social and environmental assessment, risks would be identified within the CESMP, which would include the categories for the environmental and social aspects outlined within the Updated ESIA. \n",
      "Section 23: 3.8 \tMonitoring, Recording, Inspection and Auditing Program  Daily inspections of work areas by the EPC Contractor Supervisor and weekly inspections as a minimum by the Environmental/Social Manager will also need to be conducted to identify any issues or non-compliance with the CESMP and to monitor the daily work practices.    A weekly inspection checklist will be prepared and will be provided to the External Auditors for evaluation, which will involve all the subcontractors to discuss environmental and social issues and their rectifications.  Independent audits need to be undertaken quarterly by an external consultant to ensure that the lenders can receive periodic updates regarding the environmental and social performance of the project. Such audits will check the following:   Compliance with applicable national standards and regulatory requirements (including lender requirements), as per the CESMP and site-specific procedures/method statements;  Checks on site works, monitoring records, inspection checklists, and other relevant documentation;  Identification and documentation of non-conformances,  \tIdentifying the requirements for corrective actions.   The outcomes of the audit will be documented including non-conformances, recommendations and corrective actions. \n",
      "Section 24: 3.9 \tCommunication and Grievances  Communication, both internally and externally, are an important aspect of successful project delivery. Internal communication include arranging regular meetings for the Project team to review and co-ordinate project progress with regards to environmental and community issues.  \n",
      "Section 25: Public Communication Program   The Project developer will prepare and implement a Public Communication Program to provide ongoing information to the affected Stakeholders and general public on the key relevant environmental and social aspects throughout the construction phase. This program will build upon the Stakeholder Engagement Plan (SEP) to be prepared separately to the Updated ESIA, and will utilise mass media, bulletins and other communication forms to communicate and consult with affected Stakeholders.   The main actions of the Public Communication Program are:  Timely and appropriate provision of information to the local communities prior to and during the construction activities (directly by Project developer and/or through the Construction Contractors).  Twice yearly update of the project status by the Project developer to the local communities.  Provision of specific information on an as need basis, should any significant changes in the project planning occur, which may affect certain Stakeholders (e.g. realignment of access roads, or change of construction schedule).  The Public Communication Program will be coupled with the Grievance Mechanism, which provides Stakeholders a way to formally register any complaints/ grievances to the project developer about the Project’s environmental and social performance. Such a mechanism will include a signboard along the projects boundary which will provide the contact numbers/details of the Project Team, in order for the local community to be able to contact them.  The grievance mechanism seeks to resolve concerns promptly, using a transparent process that is culturally appropriate and readily accessible at no cost and without retribution to the party that originated the issue or concern. The mechanism covers any type of complaint whatever the subject and nature, and will include the following steps:  All grievances will be logged (by methods outlined in the SEP) and reviewed by the Environmental & Social Manager.   The Site Environmental & Social Manager will identify the mechanism to redress the grievance, will identify the party responsible for accomplishing the task and will issue the instruction to complete the action.   The site Environmental & Social Manager will review the adequacy of the action and approve the completion of the action.  All steps of the process will be logged in the Grievance register and the relevant environmental issue of the CESMP will be updated accordingly (i.e. monitoring, training, material supplies, budgeting, staffing… etc).  The Grievance Mechanism will be updated as appropriate during the project lifecycle. The EPC Contractor will also be required to implement a Grievance Mechanism to address as efficiently and directly as possible any complaints from the stakeholders. \n",
      "Section 26: 3.10 Document Control and Review  All documents relevant to the CESMP will be controlled onsite. The controlled documents include the CESMP report, procedures, audit reports, incident reports, records, and community complaints. The EPC Environmental and Social Manager will be responsible for the quarterly review of the CESMP, its procedures and its implementation on site. If any new machinery or process is introduced on site, the existing CESMP will be updated accordingly. \n",
      "Section 27: 3.11 Mitigation & Management Measures, Regulations and Procedures  This Outline ESMMP recommends mitigation & management measures for the identified potential environmental and social impacts at the construction phase, as identified in the Updated ESIA Volume 2.   Design phase mitigation measures have also been recommended for consideration during the detailed design of the projects various facilities. Typically, the recommendations involve the use of pollution control technologies to minimise the environmental and social impacts.  The mitigation & management measures presented have been developed from Best Management Practices (BMP) source controls and engineering controls.   It will be noted that the measures outlined in the relevant chapter of the Updated ESIA (Volume 2) will also be implemented in addition to the ones listed in the following sections.   The overall effectiveness of the mitigation & management measures will be assessed by site monitoring programs, which will be implemented during the construction and operation phases of the project. The monitoring activities will also be designed to evaluate the project’s compliance against environmental and social guidelines. \n",
      "Section 28: Emergency Preparedness and Response Planning  A key plan that needs to be developed in line with the CESMP is the ‘Emergency  Preparedness and Response Plan’. This plan is of particular importance for the ACWA Power Zarqa CCGT project due to the location of the project in an existing industrial area of Zarqa in very close proximity to other industrial facilities, such as the Petrochemical refinery and the decommissioned Hussein TPS HFO plant.  It is understood that CEGCO have an existing emergency preparedness and response plan in place for the HTPS HFO Plant, which is likely to incorporate a significant amount of important and site/area specific detail regarding potential emergency situations. The EPC Contractors site specific Emergency Preparedness and Response plan shall be developed in co-ordination with the existing plan as a minimum. Further to this, the plan shall be consistent with any plans available locally or those in place at other facilities (i.e. where wider emergencies from the petrochemical refinery could have an impacts upon the project site).   Where potential emergencies from the proposed project may put local communities and other commerce at risk, the projects plan shall include mechanisms for notification, assistance and evacuation (if necessary) of any local areas.  The plan must include specific contact details (Site Manager, HSE Manager, Site Nurse etc.), including a contact hierarchy in case of emergency, including details of external agencies who may assist (e.g. Civil Defence, Healthcare services) in response or who should otherwise be notified (Government, NEPCO etc.).

The following chapter provides a framework for the preparation of the site-specific OESMP by the O&M Company. It is recommended that the OESMP be finalised, 2 months prior to the start of operations. \n",
      "Section 32: 4.1 \tOperational \tEnvironmental \tand \tSocial \tManagement \tPlan \t(OESMP) Requirements  The OESMP establishes mechanisms for the identification and implementation of environmental and social protection, mitigation, monitoring and institutional measures that will be taken during the operational phase of the proposed project. Such measure will be implemented to ensure compliance to the Jordanian standards and lender requirements respective for the project. All currently applicable regulation and standards for the project are detailed in Volume 2 of the Updated ESIA.  The purpose of preparing and implementing the OESMP is to ensure necessary mitigation to manage the potential adverse environmental and social impacts associated with the operation of the proposed project to acceptable levels (or to ameliorate positive impacts).  The OESMP will also need to identity the objectives, specify the monitoring requirements and measures which will include all the parameters required to be monitored, methods, sampling locations, measurement frequency, detection limits and the threshold where corrective actions are required (see section below).   The OESMP will be site specific and clearly state what issues are of specific relevance to the site.  It will need to:  Fulfil statutory requirements;  Highlight the applicable environmental guidelines, regulations/the legislative context;  Highlight the agreed social and community mitigation actions and awareness programs  Establish operational Environmental and Social Objectives;  List the identified Environmental and Social Aspects addressed in the Updated ESIA;  Develop and implement relevant procedures;  Develop a programme of continuous environmental and social improvement  Clearly specify roles and responsibilities; and  Highlight the procedures to be considered in the event of an environmental monitoring trigger level being breached or an unforeseen impact arising.  The OESMP will also identify the operational briefing and training requirements. Training can be provided in different forms such as induction sessions, training packs detailing good practices, or ‘toolbox talks’.  In addition, it is important for the OESMP to accommodate changes in conditions and respond to any need for further assessment requirements. Changes are most likely to arise if   I. A new environmental or social sensitivity is identified as a consequence of changing environmental and social conditions and more detailed survey work or  II. Changes are introduced to the installations/development design.  Documentation and communication protocols will also be required to be identified within the OESMP. Communication protocol will include   Incident/emergency communication procedure,  V. \tInternal communications, external communications,  VI. \tManagement of external/internal inquiries.   International good practice of ESMP structure details that the following items will be included: (source: Practitioner – Environmental Management Plan, Best Practice Series, The Institute of Environmental Management and Assessment, Vol. 12, December 2008):  Introduction – including summary of the project and aim of the OESMP;  Project team roles and responsibilities;  Summary of procedures – to be followed in the event of an emergency or breaching of OESMP measures;  Consents and permissions – this will provide a record of the consents with which the project is taking place;  Environmentally and Socially significant changes – detailed procedures to be followed if any significant changes are encountered once a project commences on the ground which would result in any changes to the OESMP;  Register of site-specific environmental actions and social initiatives – this information, forming the core of the document, will be detailed for each action/initiative; a tabular format is often used to provide clarity and ease of reference.  In addition, it will include (i) a programme that indicates when measures will be implemented and (ii) monitoring with indicators– to detail monitoring equipment/methods, schedule, frequency, guidelines and regulatory compliance;  Liaison and consultation requirements;  Register of variation – a tabular format document to record changes to procedures, design and mitigation and the implications of these changes and authorised personnel; and  Technical schedule – to provide further details on measures, e.g. monitoring methodologies to be followed, maps delineating boundaries/areas applicable to certain measures. \n",
      "Section 33: 4.1.1 \tProcedural Mitigation Measures, Regulations and Procedure  The procedural measures during operation phase will be similar to the construction phase, but shall be specific for the operational phase. For instance, the Emergency Preparedness and Response Plan shall be aligned to operational risks, but shall implement similar mechanisms to those during construction.  Therefore, similar control techniques and mitigation & management measures will be in place to tackle such risks. These typically include the use of pollution control technologies to minimise the environmental impacts and community awareness and integration initiatives.  The mitigation & management measures presented have been developed from Best Management Practices (BMP) source controls and engineering controls.   It will also be noted that mitigation & management measures outlined in the Updated ESIA (Volume 2) will also be implemented and included in the OESMP wherever necessary.   The overall effectiveness of the mitigation & management measures will be assessed by site monitoring programs, which will be implemented during the operation phases of the project. The monitoring activities will also be designed to evaluate the project’s compliance against environmental guidelines and community awareness initiatives.   \n",

Volume 2 of this Updated ESIA outlines the specific standards that require compliance in regard to the Jordanian and lender requirements. The applicable legislation is detailed for Jordan, and where specific lender standards/guideline exist, these have also been included to the following tables.  With regards to cost, it should be noted that the majority of the recommended mitigation measures relate to integrating appropriate management strategies and work practices.  Therefore very few of the proposed mitigation strategies require the purchase of additional materials or the construction of additional structures that have not been already integrated in the design and operation activities.  \n",

      "Section 71: 6.1 \tIntroduction  The objective of an environmental monitoring plan is to establish the baseline indicators to assess the overall performance and effectiveness of the environmental management programs. A monitoring program has the underlying objective of ensuring that the intended environmental mitigations are realised and that minimal deterioration occurs to the environmental parameters. The environmental monitoring program will aid management in redefining the environmental program objectives and where necessary, re-allocate the budget for implementing pollution control systems, employees’ awareness and training programs, implementing pollution prevention opportunities etc. The broad objectives of the Environmental Monitoring Plan are:  To evaluate the performance of mitigation & management measures proposed in the ESMP;  To evaluate the adequacy of Environmental Assessment;  To suggest ongoing improvements in the management plan based on the monitoring and to devise fresh monitoring on the basis of the improved ESMP;  To enhance environmental quality through proper implementation of suggested mitigation & management measures; and  To meet the requirements of the existing environmental regulatory guidelines and community obligations.  The detailed monitoring plan strategy will be determined in consultation with the Ministry of Environment and the lending banks, and will enable the ACWA Power Zarqa CCGT Project to comply with regulatory requirements for monitoring during the operational phase and in order to monitor environmental aspects during the construction stage.  Monitoring data will be analysed and reviewed at regular intervals and compared with the operating standards so that any necessary corrective actions can be taken.   Additional guidance on applicable sampling and analytical methods for emissions and effluents that will be considered is provided in the IFC’s General EHS Guidelines (2007).  Based on the mitigation recommendations in the Updated ESIA, the following environmental parameters will be monitored.  It should be noted that this table is a summary only, and the details of the methods, parameters and frequencies are provided in the subsequent discussion.  A general monitoring plan for the proposed project is also suggested in the following sections. It is suggested to incorporate these in individual monitoring plans developed during construction and operation phase.   All monitoring results will be recorded in the site Environmental Monitoring Program register. \n",
      "Section 72: 6.1.1 \tMonitoring Program for Construction Phase  The construction phase compliance monitoring will be carried out on a regular basis, using various techniques and at different intervals, by various parties. This will ensure that all activities are carried out in compliance with existing local and international standards and according to the proposed CESMP. Recommended construction phase monitoring activities are described below. These monitoring activities are to be finalised by the EPC as part of the Construction – Environmental & Social Monitoring Plan.   ACWA Power Zarqa CCGT Project  Updated ESIA - Volume 3, July 2016 (ISSUE 3) \t \t65     \n",
      "Section 73: 6.1.2 \tMonitoring Program for Operation Phase  The monitoring program during the operation phase provides a means of validation of the implementation and effectiveness of the mitigation & management measures incorporated in the ACWA Power Zarqa CCGT Project and developed during the Updated ESIA process, while allowing residual impacts to be predicted. This information can be used to refine the existing mitigation and, if necessary, aid in the development of additional mitigation and management measures. These monitoring activities are to be finalised by the O&M Company as part of the Operational – Environmental & Social Monitoring Plan. \n",
      "Section 74: 6.1.3 \tMethods  Compliance monitoring will be conducted through regular environmental inspections, audits, control feed-back mechanisms, document control, and reviews to check if activities and operations are in compliance with proposed Jordanian standards and lender requirements.  Environmental compliance monitoring will be carried out on several different levels, namely:  Site personnel will make general observations from their day to day activities in regard to general monitoring and monitoring detailed in the mitigation plan for ‘as required/daily/general’;  The on-site team will have specific inspection programmes upon which monitoring for a checklist of parameters can be assessed visually or by equipment in place on a rapid basis, against a set checklist;  Site personnel guided by the Environment & Social Manager will conduct continuous and/or field and laboratory monitoring of physical measurements (e.g. air, water, noise);  The project is required to report to the lenders through periodic independent updates (construction and operation). An independent environmental consultant will be engaged to undertake such audits, in line with the CESMP /OESMP to monitor project compliance against Jordanian standards and lender requirements.   If any non-compliance is found during any of control mechanisms, the adequate correction measures will be taken. Each non-compliance will be followed-up by an investigation which will be carried out to identify sources and/or reasons for non-compliance. Based on follow up investigation results, adequate prevention measures will be implemented to ensure that non compliance will not reoccur. \n",
      "Section 75: 6.2 \tMonitoring Plan Template  The following table is a very basic template design to help develop a more detailed procedure and reporting format.  The government authorities will also provide the outline of the format and content of a monitoring plan that will be used for regulatory reporting purposes.  In order to simplify the process, it is best to therefore adopt the regulatory authorities monitoring report template, in order to avoid duplication of works.  Furthermore, the regulatory authority will provide further input to the content and methodology as is fitting to the project needs and phases of construction and operation.
